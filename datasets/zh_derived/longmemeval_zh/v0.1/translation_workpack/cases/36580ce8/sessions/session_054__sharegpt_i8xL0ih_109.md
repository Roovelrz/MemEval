ME2.4: Overview of how to use groupby and pivot tables to summarize data
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Background

As a data analyst at a bank, you often need to summarize large amounts of transactional data to better understand customer behavior, trends and patterns. This exercise will cover how to use Pandas groupby and pivot table functionality to group and aggregate data, and how to generate summary statistics.

### Objective

The objective of this exercise is to learn how to use the groupby and pivot table functions in Pandas to summarize transactional data.

### Steps

1. Load the banking transaction data from the CSV file using Pandas.
2. Use the groupby function to group the data by customer ID and transaction type.
3. Aggregate the data using sum, mean, and count functions.
4. Use the pivot table function to generate summary statistics by customer ID and transaction type.
5. Output the summary statistics to a new CSV file.

### Example Solution
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the banking transaction data
df = pd.read_csv('banking_data.csv')

# Group the data by customer ID and transaction type
grouped_data = df.groupby(['customer_id', 'transaction_type'])

# Aggregate the data using sum, mean, and count functions
aggregated_data = grouped_data.agg({
    'amount': ['sum', 'mean'],
    'transaction_type': 'count'
})

# Use the pivot table function to generate summary statistics
pivot_table = pd.pivot_table(df, 
               values='amount', 
               index=['customer_id'], 
               columns=['transaction_type'], 
               aggfunc={'amount': [sum, 'mean']})

# Output the summary statistics to a new CSV file
aggregated_data.to_csv('transaction_summary.csv')
pivot_table.to_csv('pivot_summary.csv')
```
### Expected Output

Two new CSV files will be generated, `transaction_summary.csv` and `pivot_summary.csv`, each containing summarized data based on the steps outlined above. The output will show the total and average transaction amounts, as well as the number of transactions, grouped by customer ID and transaction type.

ME2.5 - Demonstration of how to perform time series analysis using Pandas
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Background:

As a data analyst at a bank, you have been asked to analyze banking transaction data over a period of time to identify trends and patterns. In this exercise, you will use Pandas to perform time series analysis on banking transaction data.

### Objective:

To demonstrate how to perform time series analysis using Pandas and extract useful insights from banking transaction data.

### Steps:

1. Load the banking transaction data from the CSV file using Pandas
2. Convert the 'Transaction Date' column to a Pandas datetime format
3. Set the 'Transaction Date' column as the index for the DataFrame
4. Resample the data to daily frequency and aggregate by the sum of the 'Amount' column
5. Calculate the rolling mean and standard deviation of the daily transaction amounts over a 7-day period
6. Plot the daily transaction amounts, rolling mean and standard deviation on a line chart using Matplotlib

### Example Solution:
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('banking_data.csv')

# Step 2: Convert the 'Transaction Date' column to datetime format
df['Transaction Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Transaction Date'])

# Step 3: Set the 'Transaction Date' column as the index
df.set_index('Transaction Date', inplace=True)

# Step 4: Resample the data to daily frequency and aggregate by sum
daily_transactions = df['Amount'].resample('D').sum()

# Step 5: Calculate the rolling mean and standard deviation
rolling_mean = daily_transactions.rolling(window=7).mean()
rolling_std = daily_transactions.rolling(window=7).std()

# Step 6: Plot the data
plt.plot(daily_transactions, label='Daily Transactions')
plt.plot(rolling_mean, label='Rolling Mean (7-day)')
plt.plot(rolling_std, label='Rolling Std (7-day)')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```
### Expected Output:

A line chart showing the daily transaction amounts, rolling mean and standard deviation over a 7-day period. The chart should be properly labeled and have a legend showing the different series.

Let continue to work on some practical examples with Python code examples where possible.

As mentioned, we will do this for every module. We will focus on the items we came up under each module topic called "Practical example".

Let's name the exercises:
 - Module Exercise (ME) 1.1,
 - ME1.2
 - ME1.3 (for module 1 exercise)
 - ME1.4

and so forth.

Let's thus start with Module 1 exercises.

Please make all exercises as relevant or applicable to the banking industry as possible.

Please propose and construct the first exercise ME1.1 with Python code, based on what we discussed being "Example code for using control flow statements to process banking data".

Let us base our coding exercises of the following list which we proposed for module 1:

 ## Practical exercises and examples
ME3.1 - Example code for reading and cleaning data from a CSV file using Python
ME3.2 - Demonstration of how to manipulate Excel files using Python and the xlwings library
ME3.3 - Example code for converting and merging multiple CSV files using Python
ME3.4 - Overview of how to work with compressed files using Python

With this in mind, let us now start again with ME3.1:

ME3.1:

Exercise: Reading and Cleaning Data from a CSV File Using Python

Background: As a data analyst at a bank, you are often tasked with processing large amounts of banking data to identify trends and insights. In this exercise, you will practice reading and cleaning data from a CSV file using Python.

Objective: The objective of this exercise is to demonstrate how to use Python to read in a CSV file containing banking data and clean it by removing any null values and converting data types as necessary.

Steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries, including Pandas.
2. Read in the banking data CSV file using the Pandas read\_csv() function.
3. Use the Pandas dropna() function to remove any rows with null values.
4. Convert any necessary columns to the appropriate data types using the Pandas astype() function.
5. Save the cleaned data to a new CSV file using the Pandas to\_csv() function.

Example Solution:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Read in the banking data CSV file
bank_data = pd.read_csv('banking_data.csv')

# Remove any rows with null values
bank_data = bank_data.dropna()

# Convert any necessary columns to the appropriate data types
bank_data['Transaction Date'] = pd.to_datetime(bank_data['Transaction Date'])
bank_data['Transaction Amount'] = bank_data['Transaction Amount'].astype(float)

# Save the cleaned data to a new CSV file
bank_data.to_csv('cleaned_banking_data.csv', index=False)
```
Expected Output: The cleaned banking data will be saved to a new CSV file called `cleaned_banking_data.csv` with any null values removed and data types appropriately converted.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Background

As a data analyst at a bank, you are often tasked with analyzing large amounts of data stored in Excel files. In this exercise, you will learn how to manipulate Excel files using Python and the xlwings library.

### Objective

The objective of this exercise is to demonstrate how to use Python and the xlwings library to read, write, and manipulate Excel files.

### Steps

1. Install the xlwings library using pip.
2. Open an Excel file in Python using xlwings.
3. Read data from a specific sheet and range in the Excel file.
4. Write data to a specific sheet and range in the Excel file.
5. Manipulate the data in the Excel file using Python.
6. Save the modified Excel file.

### Example Solution
```python
import xlwings as xw

# Step 2: Open the Excel file
workbook = xw.Book('example.xlsx')

# Step 3: Read data from a specific sheet and range
worksheet = workbook.sheets['Sheet1']
data_range = worksheet.range('A1:C10')
data = data_range.value

# Step 4: Write data to a specific sheet and range
new_data = [['New Value 1', 'New Value 2', 'New Value 3'],
            ['New Value 4', 'New Value 5', 'New Value 6']]
new_data_range = worksheet.range('A11:C12')
new_data_range.value = new_data

# Step 5: Manipulate the data in the Excel file
for row in data_range.rows:
    row[0].value = row[0].value.upper()

# Step 6: Save the modified Excel file
workbook.save('example_modified.xlsx')
```
### Expected Output

The code above will open an Excel file called `example.xlsx`, read data from the sheet named `Sheet1` and range `A1:C10`, write new data to range `A11:C12`, capitalize all values in the first column of the original data, and save the modified Excel file as `example_modified.xlsx`. The expected output is a modified Excel file with the original data and new data written to specific ranges, and the first column of the original data capitalized.
