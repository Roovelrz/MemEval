Implementing export options is an important step in implementing the features of your web-based commercial appraisal report writing application. Here are some steps you can follow to implement export options for exporting the final appraisal report in a variety of formats:

1. Define the export formats: Define the export formats that users should be able to choose from, such as PDF, Word, and Excel.
2. Implement the export functions: Implement the export functions for each format using PHP libraries or external APIs. For example, you can use the PHPWord library to export the report to a Microsoft Word document, or the PHPExcel library to export the report to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.
3. Add export options to the user interface: Add export options to the user interface, such as a drop-down menu or a set of radio buttons, to allow the user to choose the desired export format.
4. Generate the export: Generate the export in the chosen format by using the appropriate PHP library or external API. Here is an example of exporting a report to a PDF using the TCPDF library:
```php
require_once('tcpdf/tcpdf.php');

$pdf = new TCPDF(PDF_PAGE_ORIENTATION, PDF_UNIT, PDF_PAGE_FORMAT, true, 'UTF-8', false);

$pdf->AddPage();
$pdf->writeHTML($report, true, false, true, false, '');
$pdf->Output('appraisal_report.pdf', 'D');
```
5. Test the exports: Test the exports by generating sample reports and exporting them in different formats. If the exports are generated correctly, the export options are working as expected.

By following these steps, you can implement export options for exporting the final appraisal report in a variety of formats in your web-based commercial appraisal report writing application. If you need further assistance, please let me know.

**Overview of the Income Approach and Capitalization Rate Used**

The income approach is a valuation method that estimates the value of a property based on its expected income. The following are the key components of the income approach used in this appraisal:

1. **Capitalization Rate:** The capitalization rate is used to convert the net operating income of the property into an estimated value. The capitalization rate used in this appraisal is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (user fills in capitalization rate).
2. **Income and Expense Analysis:** To determine the net operating income of the property, an analysis was conducted of the income and expenses associated with the property. This analysis included the following:
	* **Rent Roll:** A rent roll was prepared, which lists the current and potential rents for the property. The gross income and net income were calculated for each unit, and the total gross and net income for the property were determined. The rent roll is included in the appraisal report as Appendix A.
	* **Operating Expenses:** A list of all operating expenses for the property was compiled. These expenses were categorized as either recurring or non-recurring expenses. The operating expenses for the property are included in the appraisal report as Appendix B.
	* **Vacancy and Collection Loss:** Vacancy and collection loss were calculated based on historical data and industry norms. The vacancy and collection loss for the property is included in the appraisal report as Appendix C.
3. **Value Estimation:** The value of the property was estimated using the income approach and the capitalization rate identified above. The income approach value is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (user fills in income approach value).
