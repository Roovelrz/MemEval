Introduction
The doctor’s surgery in Newtown is considering moving their appointments details from a spreadsheet based
system onto a relational database. The doctor’s surgery looks after the health of the town’s residents who
can book an appointment to meet with each resident’s registered doctor. To help with the running of the
surgery, they maintain a spreadsheet of the name, address, date of birth and phone number of each patient.
The spreadsheet also stores information on each patient’s most recent diagnosed condition, any current
medication the patient is taking due to their recent condition, as well as any known allergies the patients
may have.
The current way in which the data are stored is shown in the table below. Note that each doctor can be
registered to more than one patient and each patient can have more than one registered doctor. A patient
can also be seen by a doctor that they are not registered with. The ‘Known allergies’ and ‘Current
Medication’ columns are empty unless populated by the doctor. An appointment cannot exist without a
patient or doctor, of course.

To improve the management of patient information, the doctor's surgery in Newtown is considering moving their appointments details from a spreadsheet-based system to a relational database. Currently, the surgery maintains a spreadsheet containing the patient's name, address, date of birth, phone number, registered doctors, recent condition, known allergies, current medication, and appointment details.

In the existing system, each doctor can be registered to more than one patient, and each patient can have more than one registered doctor. Moreover, a patient can be seen by a doctor who is not their registered doctor. The known allergies and current medication columns are empty unless the doctor fills them. An appointment cannot exist without a patient or doctor.

By moving to a relational database, the surgery can improve the organization, accuracy, and accessibility of patient information. They can also simplify the process of managing appointments, medication, and allergies. In the next sections, we will explore the benefits of using a relational database and discuss the database schema for the doctor's surgery in Newtown.

Decompose the design to create a schema to store the data in a suitable
normal form (2NF or 3NF). Say which normal form each table in the design is in and justify your
choice. List the tables and show the fields, primary keys, and any foreign keys in your schema.
Describe any assumptions you have made or any additional fields you have added to your
design. Make sure all the primary keys are a sensible choice and introduce new fields if needed.
Draw a schema diagram to illustrate your design.

To create a suitable schema for storing the data in a normalized form, we need to first analyze the spreadsheet data and identify the functional dependencies among the attributes. Based on this analysis, we can decompose the data into tables, each table representing a single entity or relationship, and ensuring that each table is in 2NF or 3NF.

After analyzing the given data, we can identify the following entities and relationships:

* Patient
* Doctor
* Appointment
* Condition
* Medication
* Allergy

The following schema shows the tables, fields, primary keys, foreign keys, and any additional assumptions made or fields added to the design:

1. Patient Table
* PatientID (Primary Key)
* Name
* Address
* DateOfBirth
* PhoneNumber
2. Doctor Table
* DoctorID (Primary Key)
* Name
* Specialization
3. Appointment Table
* AppointmentID (Primary Key)
* AppointmentDate
* PatientID (Foreign Key references Patient Table)
* DoctorID (Foreign Key references Doctor Table)
4. Condition Table
* ConditionID (Primary Key)
* ConditionName
5. Medication Table
* MedicationID (Primary Key)
* MedicationName
6. Allergy Table
* AllergyID (Primary Key)
* AllergyName
7. PatientCondition Table (Association Table between Patient and Condition)
* PatientID (Foreign Key references Patient Table)
* ConditionID (Foreign Key references Condition Table)
* DateDiagnosed
8. PatientMedication Table (Association Table between Patient and Medication)
* PatientID (Foreign Key references Patient Table)
* MedicationID (Foreign Key references Medication Table)
* PrescriptionDate
9. PatientAllergy Table (Association Table between Patient and Allergy)
* PatientID (Foreign Key references Patient Table)
* AllergyID (Foreign Key references Allergy Table)

Assumptions Made:

* Each patient has only one phone number.
* Each doctor has only one specialization.
* A patient can have multiple conditions, medications, and allergies.
* A patient can be prescribed multiple medications for different conditions.
* An appointment can only be associated with one patient and one doctor.
* Each condition, medication, and allergy has a unique name.

The schema diagram for the designed database is shown below:

![Doctor's Surgery Schema Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/vaLDMYP.png)

Overall, this schema design is in 3NF because each table contains only non-transitive dependencies, and all the attributes in each table depend only on the primary key.

The entity relationship diagram for the doctor's surgery database schema is shown below:

![Doctor's Surgery Entity Relationship Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/PzOvrj9.png)

This diagram shows the relationships among the entities Patient, Doctor, Appointment, Condition, Medication, and Allergy, as well as the association tables PatientCondition, PatientMedication, and PatientAllergy. Each entity is represented as a rectangle, and the relationships between entities are represented as lines connecting the rectangles. The crow's foot notation is used to indicate the type of relationship between entities, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. The primary key for each entity is underlined, and foreign keys are denoted by arrows pointing to the related entity's primary key.

The diagram shows that each patient can have multiple appointments, conditions, medications, and allergies. Each doctor can have multiple appointments and be associated with multiple patients. Each condition, medication, and allergy can be associated with multiple patients. The association tables PatientCondition, PatientMedication, and PatientAllergy represent the many-to-many relationships between patients and conditions, medications, and allergies, respectively.

i. Return a list of all patient names:
```sql
SELECT `Patient Name` FROM Patient;
```
ii. Return a list of all patient addresses, showing each address only once:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `Patient Address` FROM Patient;
```
iii. Write a query to count how many patients have Dr Jenkins as one of their registered doctors:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM PatientDoctor WHERE `Doctor ID` = 1;
```
(Note: Assuming `Doctor ID` 1 corresponds to Dr. Jenkins)

iv. Calculate the average age of all patients:
```sql
SELECT AVG(YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(`Patient Date of Birth`)) AS `Average Age` FROM Patient;
```
v. Return all the patients whose last name is ‘Jones’:

(Note: Assuming that the full name is stored in the `Patient Name` field and that last names come after first names separated by a space)
```sql
SELECT `Patient Name` FROM Patient WHERE `Patient Name` LIKE '% Jones%';
```
vi. Find the names of the patients that were born before 1st January 1980:
```sql
SELECT `Patient Name` FROM Patient WHERE `Patient Date of Birth` < '1980-01-01';
```
vii. List all the patients’ names along with their registered doctors’ names:
```sql
SELECT Patient.`Patient Name`, Doctor.`Doctor Name` 
FROM Patient 
JOIN PatientDoctor ON Patient.`Patient ID` = PatientDoctor.`Patient ID`
JOIN Doctor ON PatientDoctor.`Doctor ID` = Doctor.`Doctor ID`;
```
viii. List all the patients who are currently taking medication. Give the name of the patient, their current medication, and the recent condition they are taking the medication for:
```sql
SELECT Patient.`Patient Name`, Medication.`Medication Name`, Condition.`Condition Name`
FROM Patient 
JOIN PatientMedication ON Patient.`Patient ID` = PatientMedication.`Patient ID`
JOIN Medication ON PatientMedication.`Medication ID` = Medication.`Medication ID`
JOIN PatientCondition ON Patient.`Patient ID` = PatientCondition.`Patient ID`
JOIN Condition ON PatientCondition.`Condition ID` = Condition.`Condition ID`
WHERE Medication.`Medication Name` IS NOT NULL;
```
ix. List all patients, giving their name and date of birth, and if the patient has had a recent condition, provide the medication they are taking. Otherwise, if the patient has had no recent condition, return null in the current medication field:
```sql
SELECT Patient.`Patient Name`, Patient.`Patient Date of Birth`, Medication.`Medication Name`
FROM Patient 
LEFT JOIN PatientCondition ON Patient.`Patient ID` = PatientCondition.`Patient ID`
LEFT JOIN PatientMedication ON Patient.`Patient ID` = PatientMedication.`Patient ID`
LEFT JOIN Condition ON PatientCondition.`Condition ID` = Condition.`Condition ID`
LEFT JOIN Medication ON PatientMedication.`Medication ID` = Medication.`Medication ID`
WHERE (Condition.`Condition Name` IS NULL AND Medication.`Medication Name` IS NULL)
    OR (Condition.`Condition Name` IS NOT NULL AND Medication.`Medication Name` IS NOT NULL);
```
(Note: This query assumes that a patient can have only one recent condition and medication. If a patient can have multiple recent conditions and medications, additional logic would be needed to determine which one to display.)
