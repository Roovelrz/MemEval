I apologize for the confusion. You are correct that the Forge interface has been updated since my previous response, and the "Create a New Site" button is no longer available.

To create a new site on Forge and configure it to use Azure as your server provider, you can follow these updated steps:

1. Log in to your Forge account on the Forge website.
2. From the Forge dashboard, click on the "Create a New Server" button.
3. In the "Create a New Server" form, enter your server details, such as the name, size, and region. Select "Azure" as your server provider.
4. Choose your Azure subscription, resource group, virtual network, and subnet.
5. Configure your server settings, such as your SSH key, database password, and backup options.
6. Review the details you entered and click on the "Create Server" button to create your new server in Forge.
7. Once your server is created, you can create a new site on your Azure server by clicking on the "Create Site" button in your server's details page.
8. In the "Create a New Site" form, enter your site details, such as the name, domain, and SSL certificate. Choose the web and database servers you want to use.
9. Review the details you entered and click on the "Create Site" button to create your new site on your Azure server.
10. You can then upload your front-end and back-end files, configure your web server and back-end server, and test and launch your site.

Note that the specific steps for configuring your Azure server and site may vary depending on your site's requirements and the Azure services you choose to use. However, Forge provides detailed documentation and support to help you through the process.

For step 2, you should choose "Custom VPS" as the server provider since Azure is not listed as a preconfigured provider in Forge.

Once you have selected "Custom VPS," you will be prompted to enter your Azure server details, such as the IP address, SSH user, and SSH port. You can find this information in the Azure portal, under the virtual machine settings for your server.

After you have entered the server details and added your SSH key, you can continue with the rest of the steps to configure your server and upload your front-end and back-end files.

To find the IP address, SSH user, and SSH port for your Azure virtual machine, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to the Azure portal at <https://portal.azure.com>.
2. In the left-hand menu, click on "Virtual machines" to view a list of your virtual machines.
3. Select the virtual machine that you want to use for your site.
4. In the virtual machine overview page, you should see the public IP address listed under the "Networking" section.
5. To find the SSH user and port, click on the "Connect" button at the top of the page.
6. In the "Connect to virtual machine" pane, select "SSH" as the type of connection.
7. Under "SSH private key," select the SSH key that you want to use to connect to your virtual machine.
8. You should then see the SSH command to connect to your virtual machine. The user and port will be listed in this command.

For example, the SSH command may look like this:
```javascript
ssh myusername@52.111.222.333 -p 22 -i ~/.ssh/myprivatekey
```
In this example, "myusername" is the SSH user, "52.111.222.333" is the IP address, and "22" is the SSH port.

Once you have this information, you can enter it in the Forge interface when creating your server.

Yes, after creating the server on Forge and connecting it to your Azure virtual machine, you will need to configure it to upload your front-end and back-end files to Azure.

Here are the general steps you can follow:

1. Log in to your server via SSH using your SSH client. You should have configured your SSH key when creating your server in Forge.
2. Once you are logged in, you can create a new directory for your website files. For example, you can create a directory called "mywebsite" using the following command:
```arduino
mkdir mywebsite
```
1. Upload your front-end files to the "mywebsite" directory using an SFTP client such as FileZilla or Cyberduck. You can also use the command-line SFTP client to upload your files.
2. Install the required software for your back-end, such as a web server, database server, and programming language environment. You can use the package manager for your operating system to install the required software.
3. Upload your back-end files to the appropriate directory. The directory and file names will depend on your back-end framework and programming language.
4. Configure your web server to serve your website files and route requests to your back-end. The configuration files will depend on your web server and framework.
5. Test your website to ensure that it is functioning correctly.

These are the basic steps you can follow to configure your server to upload your front-end and back-end files to Azure. The specific steps will depend on the software and frameworks you are using, as well as your specific requirements.

I apologize for the confusion. If you selected "Custom VPS" when creating a server in Forge, then you will not be prompted to enter Azure server details as the custom VPS option is intended for servers outside of Forge's supported providers.

Instead, to connect to your Azure virtual machine, you can use an SSH client such as PuTTY or the OpenSSH client in Linux/Mac. Here are the general steps:

1. Open your SSH client and connect to your Azure virtual machine using the public IP address of your virtual machine. You can find this IP address in the Azure portal, under the "Overview" section of your virtual machine.
2. Enter your SSH username and password when prompted. You can find the SSH username in the "Settings" section of your virtual machine in the Azure portal.
3. Once you are connected, you can navigate to the directory where you want to upload your website files.
4. Use an SFTP client such as FileZilla or Cyberduck to upload your website files to your virtual machine. You can also use the command-line SFTP client to upload your files.
5. Install the required software for your back-end, such as a web server, database server, and programming language environment. You can use the package manager for your operating system to install the required software.

8. Test your website to ensure that it is functioning correctly.

An SSH client is a program that allows you to connect to a remote server securely using the SSH protocol. Here are some examples of SSH clients:

1. PuTTY: a popular SSH client for Windows that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for connecting to remote servers via SSH.
2. OpenSSH client: a command-line SSH client that is included with most Linux and Mac operating systems. To use OpenSSH, you can open a terminal window and use the ssh command to connect to your remote server.
3. MobaXterm: a free SSH client for Windows that provides both a command-line interface and a graphical interface for connecting to remote servers via SSH.
4. SecureCRT: a commercial SSH client for Windows, Mac, and Linux that provides advanced features for managing SSH connections and sessions.
5. Bitvise SSH Client: a free SSH client for Windows that provides advanced features such as SFTP file transfers, terminal emulation, and remote desktop.

There are many other SSH clients available, but these are some of the most popular ones. You can choose the one that best fits your needs and preferences.
